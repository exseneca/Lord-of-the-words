X GUI bugs. We need to make sure the tiles can be put back on the rack. We need to have a lockable state.
X This should be easy. We can lock things 

- have the drop change the backend model - need to learn how to link javascript to python. -     

- we need to be able to play. We need a submit word button. 
- We also need to check if its legal to place tiles. 
- The logic for this will be. first go you can place tiles in the middle.
- From then on you can place tiles coming on.

- We need backend check for 'legal move'
- we have a states and then a lsit of moves that we want to add. Check if it's legal.
- Then build all the words that we have made. so run along all sides.
- Then check the dictionary for every word. Hopefully we can download a dictionary, 
and load it into memory. We should create an efficient data structure to hold it. TRY!
- Then calculate points for each word. If there are new bonus tiles we have to take them into 
account. Then add score to total. 

- Hide reveal tiles when it's not your go!
- Then finally we will make login. We create a game. - Up to four people can join the game. 
- Each player sees their tiles, the board and also the score.. 
- We can then store the history of the games you've played 

- Eventually we can add a game history, with aggregations of scores.
- Profile with best word ever played etc.. 

-- start with two player version
//// ****** ///// 
start the game initial. 
-
- Add points to letters.
- Allow non locking of tiles. 
- Add dictionary.
- Add score box. 
- Expand to multiplayers 
- Check that moves are valid. 
- Bring in revert last move button.
- Then add logins. Add security. Deploy to some cloud 
- we have an issue that when we get a list assignment out of range. 
- If we remove from the start of the list and then remove from the end. The list will have shortened
and we haven't catered to the fact that the ID's no longer match. (Well done, this error has been cracked)



X -- Add in a wordfinder function 
X -- to get the game playable. Fix the out of index issue when placing a tile. 
X-- Add in a hide/unhide tile button 
X Add points to tiles. 
X need to make the whole tile grabbable

-- Add bonus points to boards: Need to calculate a formula, for all the double words etc. then we can have a lookup dictionary and put the class of the tile in jinja templace
-- we should then use javascript ?? no just jinja to fill in the tile. 

-- Add ability to add on 

-- add the replace words function
 
Issues:
The show hide setting doesn't persist with the refresh. THis state could be saved.?
We can't click on the form texzt to fill it in, we have to click on the label??
blank tiles aren't grabbable
